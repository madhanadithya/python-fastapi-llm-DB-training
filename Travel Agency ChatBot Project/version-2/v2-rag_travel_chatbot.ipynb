      "\n",
      "1. **Incomplete Application** 📝: Missing documents or information can raise red flags. Double-check that everything is filled out correctly!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Insufficient Financial Proof** 💸: If you can’t demonstrate that you have enough funds to support yourself during your stay, it can lead to rejection. Make sure to provide clear financial statements!\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Unclear Travel Intentions** 🗺️: If the visa officer can’t determine why you’re visiting or see that you have solid plans, they might deny your application. Be specific about your itinerary!\n",

      "4. **Previous Immigration Violations** 🚷: If you’ve overstayed or violated immigration laws in the past, it’ll make getting a new visa trickier.\n",
